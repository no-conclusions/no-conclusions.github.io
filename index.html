                    I want you to imagine that you wake up without the faintest idea of what is true. All of your deep and primal human feelings that depend on certainty are upended and you find yourself with only the foggiest ideas of what is possible. You leave your bed questioning every question you have ever wondered, and some you are wondering now for the first time.
                    <div class='space'></div>
                    Some of these uncertainties are interesting, even pleasant: why do the birds chirp outside the window? what is this sensation of warmth under the blankets? how did all these colors and sounds make their way into my consciousness?
                    <div class='space'></div>
                    Some have a darker hue, but still intrigue: why am I spending my day working, inside nonetheless? what should I do with my abundant yet finite time? what do other people think?
                    <div class='space'></div>
                    Some root the core of what, until recently, you thought it meant to be human: what does it mean to love? why is my experience private, and how do I share it? is there anything but me?
                    <div class='space'></div>
                    They're only questions, and most days, even if they intrude, they can be cast aside with ease. That's good. It's healthy. No one wants to live in a world with lions jumping from the brush, especially now that the brush is gone.
                    <div class='space'></div>
                    This, conversely, is an exercise in unhealth. Everything is on the table, even the most banal consensus. I don't believe rousing these spirits is particularly good for most, but I've come to suspect that believing anything to be profoundly, incontrovertibly, capital-T True is just about the falsest thing you could do. You can consider <i>No Conclusions</i> an exercise in skepticism, past the point of adaptivity and verging towards the pathological. At least, that's what I plan on.
                    <div class='space'></div>
                    Thanks for taking the time to wonder with me. Shall we?
